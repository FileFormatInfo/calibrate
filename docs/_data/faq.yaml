- question: "What is DPI?"
  answer: |
    DPI stands for "Dots Per Inch".  It is a measure of how many pixels are in an inch on a screen. 

- question: "How does calibration work?"
  answer: |
    Adjust the DPI value until the ruler on the screen matches a real-life ruler.

- question: "Doesn't my computer already know the DPI?"
  answer: |
    Yes, but it's often wrong.  The DPI value is often set to 96 DPI, which is a common default value.
    However, the actual DPI value can be different.

- question: "Why do I need it to be exact?"
  answer: |
    The [physical storage media images](https://www.fileformat.info/media/) on [FileFormat.Info](https://www.fileformat.info/) are from 
    scans.  This means that the you can get the exact dimensions from the images if your monitor is properly calibrated.

- question: "What does my computer think the DPI is?"
  answer: |
    <table class="table table-striped border-top">
    <tr><th>Property</th><th class="text-center">Value</th></tr>
    <tr><td><code>window.devicePixelRatio</code></td><td class="text-center" id="devicePixelRatio"><i>(loading...)</i></td></tr>
    </table>

- question: "Can I use this for my website?"
  answer: |
    Sure.  Pass (as URL query string parameters) 
    * `target` - the URL of your web page.  Calibrate will expand `{DPI}` to the DPI setting.
    * `label` - the label for the button.  The default is "Continue".

- question: "What if I don't have a ruler?"
